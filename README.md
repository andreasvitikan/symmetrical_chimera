# Learning R repository

I'm trying to be more thorough in my exploring & learning of R and I'm going to be working through the books:

1. Grolemund G. Hands-on Programming with R. First edition. Oâ€™Reilly; 2014.
2. Grolemund G., Wickham H. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

and the code that I write is going to be hosted in this GitHub repository (`symmetrical_chimera`).
